# CarSpeedDetection
#Matlab
#CV
This program will measure the speed of car running at some speed. This program detects first frame when cars comes and last frame when cars go out from video frame. 
Then apply this forlmula s=dt
t=tf-ti =final frame time - initial frame time

where d calculate through euclidean distance


Just run speed.m to see detection of speed of car from given videos in same folder
